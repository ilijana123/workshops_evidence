# Workshops Evidence
REST and SOAP services implemented using Spring Boot & MySql database.
The service provides options for creating workshops, assigning specific users to the service, deleting tasks within a workshop, and updating certain parts of tasks (title, status, reassignment, etc.) within a workshop. It should also allow listing workshops based on status, priority, creation date, assigned user for organizing the entire workshop, or tasks and type.
I have integrated Spring Security with JWT authentication and implemented RESTful endpoints supporting CRUD operations using GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods.
